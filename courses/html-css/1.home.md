Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.

Visual studio code has a lot of plugins useful to develop amazing websites. Here's a list of some of them and all can be downloaded from the visual studio code extension section.

-   Prettier: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

-   Live server: Launch a development local server with live reload feature for static and dynamic pages.

-   GitLens: GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more.

-   TabNine: Code autocompleter tool that predicts the rest of the code programmers are typing — much like word or phrase autocomplete in a Google search window.
