UX means user experience it's described as anything that has an impact in how the users navigates and perceives through a product.

UX can be found everywhere like in hotels, parties, restaurants, web design, etc.

UX design is more involved on how the content and the information of a product is structured, more than the colors and visuals.

## Importance :man_shrugging:

The priority of a UX designer is to fulfill the user's needs, that's why is so important. It aims to provide positive experiences that keep users loyal to the product or brand. Additionally, a meaningful user experience allows you to define customer journeys on your website that are most conducive to business success.

Having bad UX implies that the users won't have a great experience inside the product a user designs.

## Priority the user's needs :bowing_woman:

You'll always be looking for the user to have a great experience. That's why a designer needs a clear picture of who is the final user that will be using the product.
