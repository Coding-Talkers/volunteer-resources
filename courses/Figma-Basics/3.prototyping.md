![bust_1](./images/bust_1.png)

Prototyping is an experimental process where design teams implement ideas into tangible forms from paper to digital. Teams build prototypes of varying degrees of fidelity to capture design concepts and test on users.

## What for? :man_shrugging:

It's useful to have a representation of the final products

You can have easy and quick modifications unlike programming that's a more complicated way to have a prototype.

It's cheaper to develop a design prototype because there's not much complexity unlike developing a product.
