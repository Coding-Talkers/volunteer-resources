## Figma Basics :star:

## Figma Interface :desktop_computer:

Just as you open figma you can see your recent drafts, this are the ones that you've been working lately

Also their is a page to see all of your drafts

To create a new draft, at the left menu there is a plus icon to create a new one

![interface](../images/figma-int.png)

When you try to create a new draft it will open a new interface just as follows

## Tools :toolbox:

### Top Tools :hammer:

In this section we can find the move, shape, drawing, text, comments and share tools

-   Move Tools: At the top left corner we can find this tool. Inside the move tool we can find the move and the scale tools, with this we can move our frames and layers, and also resize them.

-   Shape Tools: At the top left corner we can find this tool. With the help of the shape tool we can find and build many figures.

-   Drawing Tools: Inside this section we can find the pen and pencil tool. The pen tool is really helpful when trying to build crazy and unique shapes, also is helpful when trying to curves. The pencil is not that commonly used, but is a way to draw more freely in our canvas.

-   Text Tool: The text tool is for typing text inside our designs. The

-   Comments Tool: The comments tool can be used for feedback in someone's design to highlight an area of opportunity.

-   Share Tool: This tool is used to share our designs for someone to collaborate on, to give a review of the product, for prototyping meeting, etc.

### Frames :framed_picture:

In Figma, you can add layers directly to the Canvas. If you're designing for a specific device or screen size, you may want to create a container for your designs. This is where frames come in.

If you've used design tools before, you'll be familiar with artboards. Like artboards, frames allow you to choose an area of the canvas to create your designs in.

Unlike traditional artboards, you can also nest frames within other frames. This allows to create more complex design that work together.

Frames also give you access to extra functionality, like Layout Grids, Auto Layout, Constraints, and prototyping.

Create frames in the canvas using the frame tool. Then you can create a variety of frame sizes in the canvas.

## Selection functions :point_left:

![selection](../images/selection.png)

The selection tools appear when two or more layers are on top of each other. The different types of selection tools are:

-   Union: Combines all layers into one.
-   Subtract: Removes completely the top layer and everything that both of them intersected.
-   Intersect: Only keeps the intersection of all layers.
-   Exclude: This function does the exact opposite from intersect.

## Layering & Groups :family_man_woman_boy_boy:

Any Frames, Groups or Objects you add to the canvas will be visible in the Layers panel. You can determine if a Layer is a Frame, Group or a specific type of Object by the icon next to it.

Figma nests any child objects within their parent Group or Frame. This allows you to collapse and expand layers within a group or Frame.

New Layers will be added to the top of the list, or the top of the Group or Frame it is contained within. Or, just above the layer you currently have selected.
